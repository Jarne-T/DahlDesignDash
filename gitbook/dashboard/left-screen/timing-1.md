# Timing 1

TIME1 is a basic timing screen, including:

* Current lap
* Estimated lap time
* Previous lap&#x20;
* Session best
* Lap record

The session best time is only recorded on valid laps, so it might stay blank for a while if you're not getting a valid lap done. The same for the lap record. Lap records are stored in the file DahlDesignLapRecords.csv in the plugin folder. You can edit and delete records there.&#x20;

The color of the text on estimated lap time will change if you're on schedule for a new <mark style="background-color:green;">session best</mark> or <mark style="background-color:purple;">lap record.</mark>&#x20;

# Timing 2

TIME2 is your sector overview. Typically a screen used for chasing lap time. Sector colors:

* <mark style="background-color:red;">Invalid lap</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:green;">Increasing pace in this sector</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:purple;">Session best sector time</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:blue;">Out lap sector</mark> (only relevant for 1st sector)
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">In lap sector</mark> (only relevant for 3rd sector)

The delta times behind the sector times refers to the session best sector time. However, if you set a new best sector time, it will display the improvement from the previous session best.&#x20;

OL is optimal lap time, adding all the best valid sector times together. The value in the lower right corner the maximum brake pressure on your previous brake pedal hit. Deltas on SB and OL refer to the lap record.

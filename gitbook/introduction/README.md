### About the dashboard

This is my approach to a universal dashboard for iRacing. The aim was to make a dashboard that looks like it could be in a race car, flooded with features that are useful for simracers. I didn't want to switch dashboards between cars, and I wanted to get my monitor free from game UI - moving all relevant information over to the dashboard.

iRacing telemetry can behave strangely, and is lacking a lot of relevant information. I was bothered by telemetry used in my dash showing wrong/erratic values under some conditions, and having to filter the available SimHub properties in the dashboard editor. I started off making javascript scripts to make my own properties, but that quickly became a jungle of scripts with cross dependencies. Eventually it all grinded to a halt, and I had to learn how to build a plugin instead.&#x20;

A year later the plugin and dashboard had grown into something beatiful; offering the most complex features available, high level of customization, car specific elements, fuel/stategy information, controller and LED integration. The dashboard has a lot to tell you, but with limited space I've make algorithms to make the dash tell you what you need to know when you need to know it. Also, a lot of information is "hidden" in color coding and symbols.&#x20;

I strongly recommend giving the manual a good read to be able to take advantage of all the features the dashboard offers.&#x20;

Big thanks to the SimHub discord community, the collaborators to the Dahl Design software collection on GitHub, and special mentions to Romain Bouteiller (aka Romainrob) who got me going with writing in C#.&#x20;

Enjoy!

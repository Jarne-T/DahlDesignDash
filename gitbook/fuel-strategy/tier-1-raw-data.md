# Tier 1: Raw data

I've set this as the first tier because it is the most basic information available. That doesn't mean you should use it. Infact, it doesn't tell you anything directly related to race/strategy, but I've got the impression that a lot of people want to do the calculations themselves, and are used to looking at the raw data only.&#x20;

This data is not given much space in the dashboard, but can be found in the **Mini Fuel Bar.** The values at the bottom will be covered from left to right:

#### **Fuel**&#x20;

The amount of fuel left on the tank. This is also shown as the <mark style="background-color:blue;">blue</mark> or <mark style="background-color:blue;">blue</mark>+<mark style="background-color:green;">green</mark> part of the fuel gauge.&#x20;

#### **Fuel/Lap**

Fuel spent on a lap. The plugin collects fuel data from each lap. This is used for a dynamic calculation, using only relevant laps to calculate an average value. This value is also available in the Pit Screen (left side).&#x20;

Here is also the fuel/lap for the previous lap displayed (right side)

#### Fuel Laps

How many laps the fuel will give you. This is in itself not raw data, it is just Fuel/(Fuel/Lap) = Lap.

#### **Fuel Delta**

Not raw data. This is a more useful calculation derived from raw data, including remaining laps, race pace, information about the race leader and much more. It is covered in [Tier 2.](tier-2-fuel-delta.md)

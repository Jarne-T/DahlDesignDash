# Tier 5: Pit Screen

The pit screen can be accessed through PitMenu10 + "-" or with a dedicated button binding (plugin menu). Explaination of the various elements of this screen is covered [here.](../dashboard/fullscreen-screens/pit-screen.md)

With regards to fuel and strategy, most of the information you've been through in tiers 1 - 4 can be found here; the one word advice, the fuel bar, and all the parameters in the PitMenu12 screen. There is however a lot of useful complementary information, particulary with regards to the timing of your pit stop.

#### **Previous lap data**

The pit screen offers a set of calculations based on only the last lap fuel consumption. This is relevant when there will be a change in fuel/lap for the remainder of the session, and this change has just kicked in. It will take the dynamic fuel/lap a few laps to find out that tempo is changing permanently - while the previous lap fuel/lap will give you an idea straight away.&#x20;

Some scenarios:

* You've reached traffic after many laps in clear air, soon pitting, expect to be in traffic after pitting. Your fuel/lap is much lower in draft/traffic. Calculations based on this last lap only will be more representative.
* You've just gotten out of traffic and can go full send in clear air. Soon pitting. Expect to be in clear air after pitting. Calculations based on this last lap will be more representative.
* You're in clear air managing your fuel consumption. Soon pitting for last stint, where you wont be fuel saving. You can do the last couple of laps of the stint without fuel saving and use previous lap fuel/lap calculations as a basis for the last pit stop.
* You're in trouble, missing a few liters to get to the end. You do a single fuel saving lap to check if there is any hope. The calculations based on this lap can give you the info you need.

#### Track position

For races with two or more pit stops, or with a single pit stop where avoiding tire change is an option - the pit exit position tools are very valuable. You might not have to fuel full on your pit stop, and have to option to do a short or long second stint. You can adjust the fuel amount and toggle/untoggle tire change to see how the strategy and fuel for the next stint changes, as well as your track position after the pit stop. If you can squeeze ahead of traffic by taking a short stop, there is a lot of time gained. You might even fuel a bit less than you need to get track position, and then do some coasting/lifting.&#x20;

Note that for accurate pit stop duration timers, both the car and the track needs to be supported by the plugin. The car support has much bigger impact on the accuracy than track support.&#x20;

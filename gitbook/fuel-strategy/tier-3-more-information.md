# Tier 3: More information

There are several other elements in the dashboard that can tell you something about your fuel situation.&#x20;

### One-word advice

The box for PitMenu11 and the large text box in the pit menu will give you a one-word advice about your strategy.

* NON: This session will be finished without any pit stops for fuel
* WAIT: You'll have to fuel, but it is too early to come in
* PIT: You should come in now, or you'll be running out of fuel on the next lap.
* SAVE: It looks like there is not much fuel missing, you might make it with some fuel saving.

### Calculation accuracy

The box for PitMenu12 will be <mark style="background-color:red;">red</mark> if fuel calculations are based on very little data. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Yellow</mark> if the calculations have good data to work with, <mark style="background-color:green;">green</mark> if the calculations are based on very accurate data.&#x20;
